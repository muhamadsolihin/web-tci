                extortion of any kind. Facilitation payments, sometimes called

                the Indonesian Laws and Regulations about Anti-Corruption as
                below:<br />
                <br />
                (a) After the fall of the New Order regime, replaced by the
                Reformation period, there was MPR Decree Number XI/MPR/1998
                concerning Clean and KKN-free State Organizers. In line with the
                MPR TAP, the government of President Abdurrahman Wahid
                established state agencies to support efforts to eradicate
                corruption, including: the Joint Team for Combating Corruption
                Crimes, the National Ombudsman Commission, the Commission for
                Examining the Wealth of State Officials and several others.
                <br />
                <br />(b) Law No. 28 of 1999 concerning the Implementation of a
                Clean and KKN-free State which was formed in the era of
                President BJ Habibie in 1999 as a commitment to eradicating
                corruption after the overthrow of the New Order regime. This
                laws explains the definition of corruption, collusion and
                nepotism, all of which are despicable acts for state
                administrators. <br />
                <br />(c) Law No. 20 of 2001 in conjunction with Law No. 31/1999
                on the Eradication of Corruption Crimes which become the legal
                basis for eradicating corruption that results in harm to the
                state or the country's economy. The definition of corruption is
                explained in 13 articles in this law. Based on these articles,
                corruption is mapped into 30 forms, which are further grouped
                into 7 types, namely embezzlement in office, extortion,
                gratification, bribery, conflicts of interest in procurement,
                fraudulent acts, and state financial losses. <br />
                <br />(d) Government Regulation No. 71 of 2000 concerning
                Procedures for Implementing Community Participation and Giving
                Awards in the Prevention and Eradication of Criminal Acts of
                Corruption. Through this regulation, the government wants to
                invite the participation of the community in helping to
                eradicate corruption, namely by seeking, obtaining, providing
                data or information about corruption. The public can also submit
                suggestions and opinions to prevent and eradicate corruption.
                The rights of these communities are protected and followed up in
                case investigations by law enforcement and they will also
                receive awards from the government. <br />
                <br />(e) Law No. 30 of 2002 concerning the Corruption
                Eradication Commission which was the originator of the birth of
                the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) during Megawati
                Soekarnoputri presidency. In accordance with the mandate of the
                law, the KPK was formed with the aim of increasing the
                efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to eradicate
                corruption.This law was then refined with the revision of the
                Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) Law in 2019 with the
                issuance of Law No. 19 of 2019. It regulates the issue of
                increasing synergy between the KPK, the police and the
                prosecutor's office for handling corruption cases. <br /><br />
                (f) Law No. 15 of 2002 concerning the Crime of Money Laundering.
                This law regulates the handling of cases and reporting of money
                laundering and suspicious financial transactions as a form of
                efforts to eradicate corruption. This law also introduces the
                first institution of the Financial Transaction Reports and
                Analysis Center (PPATK) which coordinates the implementation of
                efforts to prevent and eradicate money laundering in Indonesia.
                <br />
                <br />
                (g) Presidential Regulation Number 54 of 2018 concerning the
                National Strategy for Corruption Prevention (Stranas PK). This
                Presidential Regulation is a substitute for Presidential
                Regulation No. 55 of 2012 concerning the National Strategy for
                Long-Term Prevention and Eradication of Corruption in 2012-2025
                and Medium-Term in 2012-2014 which is considered no longer in
                accordance with the development needs of preventing corruption.
                The Stranas PK contained in this Presidential Regulation is a
                national policy direction that contains the focus and targets
                for preventing corruption which is used as a reference for
                ministries, institutions, local governments and other
                stakeholders in carrying out corruption prevention actions in
                Indonesia. Meanwhile, the Corruption Prevention Action (PKA) is
                the elaboration of the focus and targets of the National
                Strategy for PKing in the form of programs and activities. There
                are three focuses in Stranas PK, namely Licensing and Commercial
                Administration, State Finance, and Law Enforcement and
                Bureaucratic Democracy.<br />
                <br />
                (h) Presidential Regulation No. 102/2020 concerning the
                Implementation of Supervision for the Eradication of Corruption
                Crimes.Issued by President Joko Widodo, this Presidential
                Regulation regulates the KPK's supervision of the institutions
                authorized to eradicate corruption, namely the Indonesian
                National Police and the Republic of Indonesia Attorney's Office.
                This Presidential Regulation is referred to as part of an effort
                to strengthen the performance of the KPK in eradicating
                corruption. This Presidential Regulation also regulates the
                authority of the KPK to take over corruption cases that are
                being handled by the Police and the Prosecutor's Office. We have
                to be extra cautious when interacting with government officials.
                Avoid taking any actions that could be perceived as seeking an
                unfair business advantage, and never seek improperly to
                influence any action or decision. When working with sub-third
                parties in connection with TCI business, take appropriate steps
                to ensure they follows similar values and principles and do not
                engage in improper or illegal conduct.
